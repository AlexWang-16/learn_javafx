# learn_javafx
Code samples and experimentation while learning JavaFX. Tutorials are numbered and progress from simple to more complex examples.

Note: I do not own these examples. They examples from following and/or modifying tutorials from [ProgrammingKnowledge](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIaUGP446_pWLgTZPiFizEMq "JavaFX Tutorial Playlist by ProgrammingKnowledge").

### JFX01
A simple JavaFX GUI Application made purely with java

### JFX02
A Simple JavaFX GUI Application that randomly generates numbers by the click of a button and displays in the windows. This application uses Scene Builder, a development tool to speed up GUI development process by offering drag and drop of GUI elements on screen.

### JFX03
JFX02 application extended to use CSS stylesheet for the entire app for improved modularity and fine tuned styling.

### JFX04
An calculator application with interface generated using Scene Builder and learning how to program logic in Model as well as Controller methods for data handling.

### JFX05
A simple login screen that takes a username: user and password: pass to display some content. If the login information is incorrect, an error message is displayed.

### JFX06
JFX05 with an image added to the scene and a button with image

### JFX07
This project focuses on the use of Combo box (a select box) and ObservableList, a container type that listens for action events to check for updates, adding or removing items from its list (perfect for interfaces).

### JFX08
A demo focusing on how ListView works. ListView is Java's term for select box in HTML. It can be a single or multiselect listbox. This demo also demonstrates how to retrieve selected items as well as adding items to the list after an event has triggered.

### JFX09
A demo showing how TreeView works. TreeView is the familiar directory structure you see when navigating folders in windows. The demo shows how to include icons and how to create the structure. Each TreeItem is represented as a node of the root node.
